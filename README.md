# TON Blockchain Language Extension

## Overview

This extension is designed for languages used in the TON blockchain. It provides essential tools and functionalities to enhance your development experience.

## Fixing the Error

If you encounter the following error:

>Tact standard library is missing! Try installing dependencies with yarn/npm install or specify tact.stdlib.path in settings.

You can resolve it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @tact-lang/compiler
```


For other languages, it's currently necessary to have libraries with the correct paths. The easiest way to create such projects is by using [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint).
